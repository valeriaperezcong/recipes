To prepare enchiladas, you need tortillas, salsa verde, chicken, cheese, sour cream, onion, and beans. Ah yeah, and cooking oil. 

First, you heat the oil in a pan and add the tortillas so you can have them fried. Once they are fried, you heat the salsa in the microwave. 

You put the chicken (already cooked of course) inside the fried tortilla, you pour the hot salsa. Once the tortilla is close you put sour cream, onion and cheese on top. Warm beans are put on the side. 

Enjoy.
